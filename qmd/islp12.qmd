## Introduction to Unsupervised Learning

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
So far, most of this course has focused on **supervised learning** methods like regression and classification.

-   **Supervised Learning:** We have a set of features (X1, X2, ..., Xp) and a response variable (Y). The Goal is to *predict* Y using the Xs. We "teach" the algorithm.
-   **Examples:** Linear regression, logistic regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Now, we'll explore **unsupervised learning**.

-   **Unsupervised Learning:** We only have features (X1, X2, ..., Xp), *without* any response variable Y. No "teaching" or "supervision".
-   **Goal:** Discover *interesting patterns* and *structure* in the data, find relationships.
-   **Examples:** Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Clustering.

## What is Unsupervised Learning?

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
Unsupervised learning is a set of statistical tools designed for situations where we have only input features and no output or response variable. Since there's no "correct answer" to guide the learning process, it's called "unsupervised." We're exploring the data without a specific prediction task in mind.

**Key Goals:**

-   **Data Visualization:** Find ways to represent the data to see patterns.
-   **Discover Subgroups:** Identify clusters or groups within the data or among the variables.
-   **Data Pre-processing:** Prepare data for supervised learning.

We will cover two major types:

1.  **Principal Components Analysis (PCA):** Used for visualization and pre-processing.
2.  **Clustering:** Discovering unknown subgroups in data.

## Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}

| Feature             | Supervised Learning                                  | Unsupervised Learning                                      |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Goal**            | Predict a response variable (Y)                     | Discover patterns and structure                             |
| **Data**            | Features (X) and response (Y)                       | Features (X) only                                         |
| **Evaluation**      | Clear metrics (e.g., accuracy, R-squared)            | More subjective, harder to evaluate                          |
| **Examples**        | Regression, classification                           | PCA, clustering                                            |
| **"Correct Answer"** | Yes (the response variable)                         | No (no response variable)                                 |

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
Unsupervised learning is often more challenging because there's no straightforward way to check our work. It's more exploratory and subjective. We don't have a "ground truth" to compare our results against.
:::
:::

## Applications of Unsupervised Learning

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
Unsupervised learning is increasingly important in various fields:

-   **Genomics:**  A cancer researcher analyzes gene expression levels in patients. Unsupervised learning can help find *subgroups* of patients or genes, leading to a better understanding of the disease.
-   **E-commerce:**  An online shopping site identifies groups of shoppers with similar browsing and purchase histories. This allows for *targeted recommendations*, showing each shopper items they're more likely to be interested in.
-   **Search Engines:**  Search results can be customized based on the *click histories* of similar users.
-   **Marketing:** Identify *market segments* (groups of customers) for targeted advertising.

These are just a few examples. Unsupervised learning is a powerful tool for extracting insights from data where there's no predefined outcome.
:::

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique to reduce the dimensionality of data while retaining as much *variability* (information) as possible. It's like finding the most important "directions" in your data.

-   **Dimensionality Reduction:**  Simplifies data by finding a smaller set of *representative variables* (principal components).
-   **Data Visualization:**  Allows us to visualize high-dimensional data in lower dimensions (e.g., 2D or 3D plots).
-   **Unsupervised:**  PCA only uses the features (X), not any response (Y).
-   **Feature Space Directions:** Identifies the directions in the feature space along which the original data varies most.
-   **Data Pre-processing:** Can be used to create new, uncorrelated features for use in supervised learning (e.g., Principal Components Regression).
:::

## What are Principal Components?

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
Imagine you have many features (variables). PCA finds new variables, called **principal components**, that are *linear combinations* of the original features.

-   **First Principal Component (Z1):** The normalized linear combination of features with the *largest variance*.  It captures the *most* variability in the data.

    -   **Normalized:**  The sum of the squared coefficients (loadings) equals 1. This prevents arbitrarily large variances.
    -   **Loadings:**  The coefficients (φ) in the linear combination. They tell us how much each original feature contributes to the principal component.

-   **Subsequent Principal Components:** Linear combinations that capture the *most remaining variance*, subject to being *uncorrelated* with previous components.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
**Formula for the first principal component:**
$$Z_1 = \phi_{11}X_1 + \phi_{21}X_2 + ... + \phi_{p1}X_p$$
where $\sum_{j=1}^{p} \phi_{j1}^2 = 1$ (normalization constraint).
:::
:::

## Geometric Interpretation of PCA

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
The principal component loading vectors define directions in the feature space.

- **First Principal Component:** The direction along which the data points *vary the most*.
- **Second Principal Component:**  The direction, *orthogonal* (perpendicular) to the first, that captures the *next most variance*. And so on.

Projecting the original data points onto these directions gives us the **principal component scores**.

![alt text](figures/6_14.png)

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
In the figure, which displays an advertising data, the green solid line represents the first principal component direction.  The blue dashed line represents the second.  Since this is a 2D example, there are only two components.
:::
:::

## Example: USArrests Data

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
Let's look at an example using the `USArrests` dataset, which contains crime statistics for each of the 50 US states:

-   **Features:**  `Murder`, `Assault`, `UrbanPop`, `Rape` (per 100,000 residents)
-   **Goal:**  Visualize the data and find patterns using PCA.

![First two principal components for the USArrests data.](figures/12_1.png)

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
This is a **biplot**.  It shows both the principal component *scores* (blue state names) and the principal component *loadings* (orange arrows).  For example, the loading for `Rape` on the first component is 0.54, and on the second component is 0.17. The word `Rape` is centered at the point (0.54, 0.17).
:::
:::

## Interpreting the USArrests Biplot

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
-   **First Principal Component (PC1):**  Places roughly equal weight on `Murder`, `Assault`, and `Rape`, with much less weight on `UrbanPop`.  This component represents overall crime rates.
-   **Second Principal Component (PC2):**  Places most of its weight on `UrbanPop`, representing the level of urbanization.
-   **Correlation:**  `Murder`, `Assault`, and `Rape` are close together, indicating they are correlated. `UrbanPop` is farther away, indicating it's less correlated with the other three.

|          | PC1     | PC2     |
| :------- | :------ | :------ |
| Murder   | 0.536   | -0.418  |
| Assault  | 0.583   | -0.188  |
| UrbanPop | 0.278   | 0.873   |
| Rape     | 0.543   | 0.167   |

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
The table shows loading vectors. States with large positive scores on PC1 (e.g., California, Nevada, Florida) have high crime rates.  States with large positive scores on PC2 (e.g., California) have high urbanization.
:::
:::

## Another Interpretation of PCA

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
Besides finding directions of greatest variance, PCA also finds *linear surfaces* that are closest to the data points.

-   **First Principal Component:** The *line* in p-dimensional space closest to the n observations (in terms of average squared Euclidean distance).
-   **First Two Principal Components:** The *plane* closest to the observations.
-   **And so on...**

![Ninety observations simulated in three dimensions.](figures/12_2.png)

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
*Left*: The first two principal component directions span the plane that best fits the data. *Right*: The first two principal component score vectors give the coordinates of the projection of the 90 observations onto the plane.
:::
:::

## Proportion of Variance Explained (PVE)

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
How much information is *lost* when we project data onto the first few principal components?  We use the **Proportion of Variance Explained (PVE)** to measure this.

-   **Total Variance:** The sum of the variances of all the original features (assuming they are centered).
-   **Variance Explained by the m-th PC:** The variance of the m-th principal component.
-   **PVE of the m-th PC:** The *proportion* of the total variance explained by the m-th principal component.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
**Formula for PVE of the m-th PC:**
$$\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} z_{im}^2}{\sum_{j=1}^{p} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{ij}^2}$$
:::
:::

## PVE: USArrests Example

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
![Scree plot and cumulative PVE plot for the USArrests data.](figures/12_3.png)

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
*Left*: A **scree plot**, showing the PVE of each principal component. *Right*: The cumulative PVE.
:::

-   **PC1:** Explains 62.0% of the variance.
-   **PC2:** Explains 24.7% of the variance.
-   **Together:** PC1 and PC2 explain almost 87% of the variance.

This means that Figure 12.1 (the biplot) provides a good two-dimensional summary of the data.  The scree plot helps us decide how many components to keep (look for an "elbow").
:::

## Scaling the Variables

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
Before performing PCA, we usually *scale* the variables to have a standard deviation of one.

-   **Why scale?**  If variables are measured in different units or have vastly different variances, the variables with the *largest variances* will dominate the principal components, regardless of whether they are actually the most *important*.
-   **Exception:**  If variables are measured in the *same units* (e.g., gene expression levels), we might *not* want to scale.

![Effect of scaling on the USArrests biplot.](figures/12_4.png)

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
*Left*: PCA with scaled variables (like Figure 12.1). *Right*: PCA with unscaled variables.  `Assault` dominates the first PC because it has the highest variance.
:::
:::

## How Many Principal Components to Use?

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
There's no single, definitive answer.  It depends on the context and the data.

-   **Scree Plot:**  Look for an "elbow" in the scree plot – a point where the PVE drops off significantly.
-   **Interpretation:**  Keep enough components to capture the *interesting patterns* in the data.
-   **Ad Hoc:**  This process is inherently subjective.
-   **Supervised Learning:**  If PCA is used for pre-processing for supervised learning (e.g., Principal Components Regression), we can use cross-validation to select the number of components.
:::

## Clustering Methods

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
Clustering aims to find *subgroups* (clusters) within a dataset.

- **Goal:** Partition observations into groups so that observations *within* a group are similar, and observations in *different* groups are dissimilar.
- **Similarity:**  What does "similar" mean? This is a crucial, often domain-specific, consideration.
- **Unsupervised:** We're looking for structure without a predefined outcome.

We'll cover two main types:

1.  **K-Means Clustering:**  Partitions data into a *pre-specified* number (K) of clusters.
2.  **Hierarchical Clustering:**  Builds a *hierarchy* of clusters, represented by a dendrogram.
:::

## K-Means Clustering

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
K-means clustering is a simple and widely used clustering algorithm.

- **Input:**  A dataset and a desired number of clusters, *K*.
- **Output:**  Assigns each observation to *exactly one* of K clusters.
- **Goal:**  Minimize the *within-cluster variation*.

![K-means clustering results on simulated data.](figures/12_7.png)

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
The results of applying K-means clustering with different values of K (the number of clusters) are presented. The color of each observation indicates the cluster to which it was assigned.
:::
:::

## The K-Means Algorithm

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
1.  **Initialization:** Randomly assign each observation to one of the K clusters.
2.  **Iteration:** Repeat until the cluster assignments stop changing:
    a.  **Compute Centroids:**  For each cluster, calculate the *centroid* (the mean vector of the observations in that cluster).
    b.  **Reassign Observations:** Assign each observation to the cluster whose centroid is *closest* (usually using Euclidean distance).

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple}
The algorithm is guaranteed to decrease the within-cluster variation at each step. It finds a *local* optimum, not necessarily the global optimum.
:::
:::

## K-Means: An Illustrative Example

```{mermaid}
graph LR
    A[Data] --> B(Step 1: Randomly Assign Clusters);
    B --> C(Iteration 1, Step 2a: Compute Centroids);
    C --> D(Iteration 1, Step 2b: Reassign Observations);
    D --> E(Iteration 2, Step 2a: Compute Centroids);
     E --> F(Iteration 2, Step 2b: Reassign Observations);
    F --> G(Final Results);

    style G fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
```

![Progress of the K-means algorithm.](figures/12_8.png)

## K-Means: Local Optima

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
Because K-means finds a local optimum, the results depend on the *initial random assignment* of observations to clusters.

-   **Recommendation:** Run K-means multiple times with different initializations and choose the solution with the *lowest* within-cluster variation.

![K-means clustering with different initializations.](figures/12_9.png)

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple}
K-means clustering was performed six times on the data, each with a different random assignment of observations. Three different local optima were obtained, one of which resulted in better separation between the clusters.
:::
:::

## Hierarchical Clustering

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
Hierarchical clustering builds a *hierarchy* of clusters, represented by a **dendrogram**.

- **Advantage:**  Doesn't require pre-specifying the number of clusters (K). We can choose the number of clusters by "cutting" the dendrogram.
- **Dendrogram:**  A tree-like diagram that shows how clusters are merged.
- **Agglomerative (Bottom-Up):**  Start with each observation as its own cluster, and successively merge the most similar clusters.

![Dendrogram of hierarchically clustering the data.](figures/12_11.png)
:::

## Interpreting a Dendrogram

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
-   **Leaves:** Represent individual observations.
-   **Fusions:**  As you move up the tree, leaves and branches *fuse*, representing the merging of similar clusters.
-   **Height of Fusion:**  Indicates the *dissimilarity* between the merged clusters.  Lower fusions mean more similar clusters.
-   **Cutting the Dendrogram:**  A horizontal cut across the dendrogram gives a specific number of clusters. The height of the cut determines the number of clusters.

![Interpreting a dendrogram.](figures/12_12.png)

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple}
The figure illustrates how to *properly* interpret a dendrogram. *Left*: A dendrogram generated using Euclidean distance and complete linkage. Observations 5 and 7 are quite similar. *Right*: The raw data used to generate the dendrogram.
:::
:::

## The Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
1.  **Initialization:** Start with each observation as its own cluster (n clusters). Calculate all pairwise dissimilarities (e.g., using Euclidean distance).
2.  **Iteration:** For i = n, n-1, ..., 2:
    a.  **Find Most Similar Clusters:** Identify the two *most similar* clusters (least dissimilar).
    b.  **Merge Clusters:** *Fuse* these two clusters into a single cluster.  The dissimilarity between these clusters is the *height* in the dendrogram where they fuse.
    c.  **Update Dissimilarities:**  Calculate the new pairwise inter-cluster dissimilarities between the remaining i-1 clusters.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple}
**Key Question:** How do we define the dissimilarity between *clusters* (groups of observations), not just individual observations? This is where **linkage** comes in.
:::
:::
## Linkage

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
**Linkage** defines the dissimilarity between two *groups* of observations.

| Linkage    | Description                                                                                                        |
| :--------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Complete   | *Maximal* intercluster dissimilarity (dissimilarity between the *most dissimilar* points in the two clusters).       |
| Single     | *Minimal* intercluster dissimilarity (dissimilarity between the *most similar* points in the two clusters).        |
| Average    | *Mean* intercluster dissimilarity (average dissimilarity between all pairs of points in the two clusters).     |
| Centroid   | Dissimilarity between the *centroids* of the two clusters.                                                        |

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple}
Average and complete linkage are generally preferred. Centroid linkage can lead to undesirable *inversions*.
:::
:::

## Choice of Dissimilarity Measure

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
Besides linkage, we also need to choose a *dissimilarity measure* between individual observations.

-   **Euclidean Distance:**  The most common choice. Measures the straight-line distance between two points.
-   **Correlation-Based Distance:**  Considers two observations similar if their features are *highly correlated*, even if their values are far apart in terms of Euclidean distance.

The choice depends on the *type of data* and the *scientific question*.

![Euclidean vs. correlation-based distance.](figures/12_15.png)
:::

## Practical Issues in Clustering

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
-   **Scaling:** Should we scale the variables before clustering? (Usually yes, to give equal weight to each variable.)
-   **Small Decisions, Big Consequences:** Choices of dissimilarity measure, linkage, and scaling can have a *large impact* on the results.
-   **Validating Clusters:**  It's hard to know if the clusters found are *real* or just an artifact of the clustering process.
-   **Robustness:** Clustering methods are often *not very robust* to small changes in the data.

**Recommendation:** Try different choices, look for consistent patterns, and be cautious about over-interpreting the results. Clustering should be a starting point for further investigation, not the final answer.
:::

## Summary

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
-   **Unsupervised learning** is about finding patterns and structure in data *without* a response variable.
-   **PCA** reduces dimensionality by finding linear combinations of features that capture the most variance. It's useful for visualization and pre-processing.
-   **Clustering** aims to find subgroups within the data.
    -   **K-means** requires pre-specifying the number of clusters (K).
    -   **Hierarchical clustering** builds a hierarchy of clusters, represented by a dendrogram.
-   Choices of dissimilarity measure, linkage (for hierarchical clustering), and scaling can significantly affect clustering results.
-   Clustering is a powerful but often subjective and non-robust technique.  It's best used for exploration and hypothesis generation.
:::

## Thoughts and Discussion

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
-   Can you think of other real-world applications where unsupervised learning might be useful?
-   What are the potential limitations of relying too heavily on clustering results without further validation?
-   How might you combine supervised and unsupervised learning techniques in a single analysis?
-	How do you understand the differences and connections between data mining, machine learning, and statistical learning?
